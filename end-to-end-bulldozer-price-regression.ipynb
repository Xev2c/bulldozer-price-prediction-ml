    "# 🚜 Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal predicting the sale price of bulldozers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem definition\n",
    "How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "The dataset is sourced from Kaggle’s **Bluebook for Bulldozers** competition and contains historical auction sales data for heavy equipment. It is used to predict the sale price of a bulldozer based on its features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **three main datasets** used in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train.csv** – The training set, which contains data through the end of **2011**.  \n",
    "- **Valid.csv** – The validation set, which contains data from **January 1, 2012 – April 30, 2012**. Predictions are made on this set during most of the competition, and the score on this set is used to create the **public leaderboard**.  \n",
    "- **Test.csv** – The test set, which is released in the final week of the competition. It contains data from **May 1, 2012 – November 2012**. The score on this set determines the **final rank** in the competition.\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is **RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error)**, which measures the difference between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about the evaluation process, visit:  \n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to **minimize the error**. For this project, the objective is to build a machine learning model that **minimizes RMSLE** to achieve better prediction performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle provides a **data dictionary** that explains all features in the dataset. This document describes each variable and its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the data dictionary on Google Sheets here:  \n",
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ly-bLR8sbDJLITkWG7ozKm8l3RyieQ2Fpgix-beSYI/edit?usp=sharing\n"
